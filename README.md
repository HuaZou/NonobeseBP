# The purpose of this study
Calorie restriction (CR), which has the potential effect on weight loss and serum metabolism, has been demonstrated to associate with human gut microbiota. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impacts of a low-calorie diet on BMI loss, the levels of blood amino acids, the gut microbiota and their potential relationships among three parties in non-obese subjects.
